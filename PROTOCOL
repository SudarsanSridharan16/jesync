JESync Alpha 0.1 Protocol Specification
Author: Julio Viera

The protocol is a simple ASCII protocol inspired on projects like memcached or 
beanstalkd


--------------------
1. Requesting a lock
--------------------

lock <lock_key>[[ <max_concurrent>[ <timeout>]]

lock_key:       Any string (no spaces) representing the lock key

max_concurrent: Max number of concurrent request allowed to run simultaneously
                with the one being requested

timeout:        Specifies the maximum time to wait in seconds for the
                lock to be granted


Response: 
GRANTED <lockKey_status> <seconds_left>

seconds_left:   Number of seconds left before the lock expires, to renew the
                grant, you need to issue another lock command

--------------------
2.Releasing a lock
--------------------

release <lock_key>

lock_key:       Any string (no spaces) representing the locked key to be
                released


Response:
If the lock was locked by the current connection
RELEASED <lockKey_status> <seconds_left>

seconds_left:   Number of seconds left before the lock expired

If the lock was not locked by the current connection
NOT_RELEASED <lockKey_status> 

--------------------
3. Lock key status
--------------------
The lock key status is written by the server when responding to any lock key
related request. The format is the following

<concurrent> <waiting> <lockKey>

concurrent:     Number of concurrent request currently accesing the lock

Waiting:        Number of request waiting to access the lock

lockkey:        The lock key

Also it is possible to ask for the status of a key anytime doing:

status <lock_key>

--------------------
4. Status listing
--------------------
A status listing can be requested to the server with the following commands

status-by-key:      Returns the list of keys sorted by its name
status-by-requests: Returns the list of keys sorted by the request queue
status-by-grants:   Returns the list of keys sorted by the numbers of current grants to that particular key
